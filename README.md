## Introduction
  - Red, Green, Blue are the primary colors associated with the electronic displays such as LCD monitors, digital cameras, scanners. 
  Every other color which we see on these displays are the combination of RGB colors in different proportions.
  - Each component red, blue and green is mentioned with the  number ranging from 0 to 255. Number 0 indicates the color of the particular 
  cell is absent and 255 indicates that particular color is present in its fullest intensity.
  - Example : **RGB(25,123,252)**
  - More than 16 million combinations can be achieved by switching the numbers of these three colors.
  - If all the three color components are mentioned as 0. It indicates no color and the result id Black. If all are mentioned as 255, then the resultant color is white.
  - ### How to play the game (Determine the color with the given RGB components):
    - **RGB(255, 0, 0)** results in red as only red component is present and that too with the maximum value.
    - **RGB(0, 255, 0)** results in green
    - **RGB(0, 0, 255)** results in Blue
    - **RGB(0, 0, 0)** results in Black
    - So, If all the three colors are near to 0, the resultant color will be dark (near to black)
    - **RGB(255, 255, 255)** results in White
    - So, If all the colors are near to 255, the resultant color will be light (near to white)
    - **RGB(255, 255, 0)** results in yellow
    - So, If R and G components are near to 255, the resultant color will be near to yellow.
    - **RGB(255, 0, 255)** results in magenta
    - So, If R and B components are near to 255, the resultant color will be near to magenta.
    - **RGB(0, 255, 255)** results in cyan
    - So, If G and B components are near to 255, the resultant color will be near to cyan.
